Here is my forecast: 

The main thing that Trump and the Republicans are focusing on in the midterms is immigration, while the Democrats are focused on healthcare reform. Although there is talk of a Blue Wave, I don't think that Democratic voter turnout will be that much larger, if at all, than Republcian voter turnout. Democrats are angry about Kavanaugh's recent nomination to the Supreme Court, and in general about having Trump as president. But Republicans are similarly energized because of the caravan, and Trump's inflammatory rhetoric.

There are several close races up for Senate. I predict that Democrats Heitkamp will lose in North Dakota, Beto will lose in Texas, and Sinema will lose in Arizona.

Projections: Democrats regain control of the House. Republicans maintain control of the Senate. 
Trump will probably never be impeached. :'(
